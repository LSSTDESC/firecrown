In the `examples` directory, we have subdirectories, each of which contains one or more related example uses of Firecrown.
These examples are generally configured to run quickly.
Thus they generally do not run any real MCMC sampling.
In each of the directories, there is a README file that contains a short description of the example and includes directions on how to run it.
Some of the examples also include a program to generate additional files needed to run the example.

Currently, all the examples use the `ConstGaussian` likelihood.

* In the `cosmicshear` directory we have a DES Y1 cosmic shear analysis.
  This example demonstrates only the use of CosmoSIS with Firecrown.
  The likelihood function created demonstrates the use of the `ConstGaussian` likelihood with `TwoPoint` statistic and the `WeakLensing` source with a `PhotoZShift` systematic.

* The `des_y1_3x2pt` directory demonstrates several related likelihoods, each created by a different factory function.
  This simplest is `des)_y1_3x2pt.py`.
  This uses a `ConstGaussian` likelihood containing a multiplicity of `TwoPoint` statistics, built from all combinations of several weak lensing sources and several number counts sources.
  It demonstrates the use of multiple systematics for a source (specifically for weak lensing sources).

  The two other likelihoods demonstrate the use of some advanced systematics.
  Perturbation theory corrections are demonstrated in `des_y1_3x2pt_PT.py`.
  TATT corrections are demonstrated in `des_y1_3x2pt_TATT.py`.

  The samples in this directory work with Cobaya, CosmoSIS, and NumCosmo.

* The `srd_sn` directory contains an example of the use of the `Supernova` statistic.
  It includes both CosmoSIS and NumCosmo examples.
  The NumCosmo example demonstrates the construction of a Fisher matrix, using an adaptive algorithm for the calculation of derivatives.

* The `cluster_number_counts` directory contains an example of the use of the `ClusterNumberCounts` statistic.
  It includes both CosmoSIS and NumCosmo examples.
