The installation methods for Firecrown support two different user roles: *developers* and *non-developers*.
One is acting as a non-developer when using Firecrown only through installed packages, and making no additions to or modifications of the Firecrown code.
One is acting as a developer when either modifying existing code, adding new code, or both.
Because Firecrown is under rapid development, we expect most users to be acting in the developer role.
That is the role we will discuss in more depth.

Developers require access to the Firecrown source code.
They also require access to the complete set of software upon which Firecrown depends, as well as the development tools we use with Firecrown.
All the software packages upon which Firecrown and its development environment rely will be installed with `conda` when possible, or with `pip` when a `conda` installation is not possible.
The Firecrown source code will be cloned from the repository on GitHub.
