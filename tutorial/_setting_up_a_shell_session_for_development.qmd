These instructions assume you have already done the installation, above, presumably in an earlier shell session.
If you have just completed the installation and are in the same shell session, you do not need to execute these commands --- you have already done so!

```{.bash}
cd THE_DIRECTORY_INTO_WHICH_YOU_DID_INSTALL_THINGS
conda activate firecrown_developer
export CSL_DIR=${PWD}/cosmosis-standard-library
export FIRECROWN_DIR=${PWD}/firecrown
export PYTHONPATH=${FIRECROWN_DIR}/build/lib
```

Each of the three defined environment variables is used for a different purpose:

1. `CSL_DIR` is used in CosmoSIS *ini* files to allow the `cosmosis` command to be run from any directory.
2. `FIRECROWN_DIR` is used in the examples that come with Firecrown.
3. `PYTHONPATH` is used by Python itself to find Firecrown modules
   Note that `PYTHONPATH` refers not to the top of the Firecrown repository, but to the subdirectory `build/lib` where later instructions will build the Firecrown code.
