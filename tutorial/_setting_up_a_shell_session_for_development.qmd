These instructions assume you have already done the installation, above, presumably in an earlier shell session.
If you have just completed the installation and are in the same shell session, you do not need to execute these commands --- you have already done so!

```{.bash}
conda activate firecrown_developer
cd ${FIRECROWN_DIR}
```

Each of the three defined environment variables is used for a different purpose:

1. `CSL_DIR` is used in CosmoSIS *ini* files to allow the `cosmosis` command to be run from any directory.
2. `FIRECROWN_DIR` is used in the examples that come with Firecrown.
