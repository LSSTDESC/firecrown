## Prologue

For the purposes of this example, by *developing a new likelihood* we mean writing the code that uses existing software element in the Firecrown package to define a likelihood for some specific data, taking into account the set of physical effects of interest for the analysis that will use this likelihood.
In Firecrown, this means writing a new *likelihood factory function* -- the function that actually creates a Python object representing a likelihood.

# Implementing a new [`ConstGaussian`]{.fragment} likelihood

## Overview

-   We will write a new *factory function* that will generate a likelihood that can be used with any of the supported samplers.
-   This likelihood will use some new data.
-   It will use some existing statistics and systematics.
-   The only new code will be our factory function, which assembles the specific instance of `ConstGaussian` that we want to use for our (toy) analysis.

## Organize your data

-   Firecrown expects data to be in [SACC](https://sacc.readthedocs.io) format.
-   Tracers: these are what you have observed
-   Covariance: correlations between observations

## Select your statistics

-   How do you predict what you expect to observe, given a cosmology?
-   What are your nuisance parameters?
  -   Encapsulate these as statistics
  -   Are they fixed values, or are you sampling over them?

## Write tests as you go along

-   You are more likely to write easy-to-use code if you actually use it as you write.
-   You are more likely to write code that achieves your purposes if you know what your purpose is as you write.
-   Writing tests as you design your code achieves both of these goals.

## Write your factory function

-   Structuring your factory function well helps make it easier for you, and others, to understand what you have written.

```{python}
import os.path 
import firecrown.likelihood.gauss_family.statistic.supernova as sn
from firecrown.likelihood.gauss_family.gaussian import ConstGaussian
import sacc

SACC_FILENAME = os.path.expandvars("${FIRECROWN_DIR}/examples/srd_sn/srd-y1-converted.sacc")

def build_likelihood(_):
    snia_stats = sn.Supernova(sacc_tracer="sn_ddf_sample")
    likelihood = ConstGaussian(statistics=[snia_stats])
    sacc_data = sacc.Sacc.load_fits(SACC_FILENAME)
    likelihood.read(sacc_data)
    # This simple likelihood has no associated ModelingTools
    return likelihood, None
```
