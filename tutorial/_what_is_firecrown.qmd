Firecrown[^firecrown] is a *software framework*[^framework] that allows you to write *likelihoods* in a way that will enable you to integrate those likelihoods with statistical frameworks for parameter estimation, forecasting, or any other purpose.
In considering our options, one possibility is to choose a single statistical framework and exclusively rely on it. 
However, different analyses may present distinct requirements that can only be effectively addressed by utilizing different statistical frameworks.
So Firecrown provides a single framework for writing likelihoods that allows DESC scientists to use those likelihoods with any of the supported statistical frameworks.
Moreover, Firecrown is intended to provide a well-defined environment in which all the DESC tools needed for likelihood-dependent analysis tasks are present.
To accomplish this objective, Firecrown directly uses the DESC Core Cosmology Library [CCL](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CCL) and the [SACC](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/SACC) data format library.

Note that Firecrown itself does not do sampling, nor does it run the sampling frameworks.
Instead, whichever sampling framework you are using calls (through the Firecrown connector code) the Firecrown likelihood you configure.

[^firecrown]: A firecrown is a hummingbird native to Chile and Argentina.
The reasons this software is named Firecrown are now lost to the mists of history.

[^framework]: A software framework is an abstraction in which software providing generic functionality can be selectively changed by additional user-written code, thus providing application-specific software. [Definition from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework).

Firecrown can also be used as a tool inside another framework.
For example, it is directly used by the DESC forecasting and inference tool [Augur](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/augur).
Augur uses Firecrown to calculate observations predicted by theory ("theory vectors") and likelihoods for those observations, and from these Augur calculates Fisher matrices.
Augur can also use Firecrown to create mock data and to run Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) parameter estimation on those data.

Firecrown currently supports three statistical frameworks: [Cobaya](https://github.com/CobayaSampler/cobaya)[^cobaya], [CosmoSIS](https://github.com/joezuntz/cosmosis)[^cosmosis], and [NumCosmo](https://github.com/NumCosmo/NumCosmo)[^numcosmo].
Firecrown guarantees that the variety of DESC tools that it uses are instantiated correctly to be consistent with the use of any of these frameworks.

[^cobaya]: Cobaya (code for bayesian analysis, and Spanish for Guinea Pig) is a framework for sampling and statistical modeling: it allows you to explore an arbitrary prior or posterior using a range of Monte Carlo samplers (including the advanced MCMC sampler from CosmoMC, and the advanced nested sampler PolyChord).
The results of the sampling can be analyzed with GetDist.
It supports MPI parallelization (and very soon HPC containerization with Docker/Shifter and Singularity).

[^cosmosis]: CosmoSIS is a cosmological parameter estimation code.
It is a framework for structuring cosmological parameter estimation with a focus on flexibility, re-usability, debugging, verifiability, and code sharing in the form of calculation modules.
It consolidates and connects existing code for predicting cosmic observables, and makes mapping out experimental likelihoods with a range of different techniques much more accessible.

[^numcosmo]: NumCosmo is a free software C library whose main purposes are to test cosmological models using observational data and to provide a set of tools to perform cosmological calculations.
Particularly, the current version has implemented three different probes: cosmic microwave background (CMB), supernovae type Ia (SNeIa), and large-scale structure (LSS) information, such as baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) and galaxy cluster abundance.
The code supports joint analyses of these data and the parameter space can include cosmological and phenomenological parameters.
