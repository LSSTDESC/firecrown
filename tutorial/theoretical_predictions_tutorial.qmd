## Prologue

This document demonstrates how to use Quarto to generate a demo of Firecrown.

## Running some code

Here is a python code block.
It starts out with the code hidden, because we have used `code-fold: true` in the YAML header.
Cllck on the triangle next to the word `code` in the code block to reveal it.
Below the code block is the output of the code.

```{python}
# This demonstrates loading firecrown and running some code.
from datetime import datetime
import firecrown
print(f"This demo was run on {datetime.now()}")
print(f"You are running Firecrown version {firecrown.__version__}")
```
