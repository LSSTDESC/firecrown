## Purpose of this Document

This document provides an overview of the Firecrown two-point factory system and links to detailed tutorials on specific topics.

## Tutorial Series

The two-point factory system is covered in the following tutorials:

### Core Factory System

1. **[Two-Point Factory Basics](two_point_factory_basics.qmd)**
   - Overview of the hierarchical metadata framework
   - Role of TwoPointFactory in constructing likelihood objects
   - Understanding the four-layer framework: bin descriptors, bin pairs, data layouts, and measurement containers
   - Comparison with the generator workflow

2. **[Loading SACC Data](two_point_sacc_loading.qmd)**
   - Extracting data from SACC files
   - Full metadata + data extraction (recommended approach)
   - Legacy indices-only extraction (deprecated)
   - Comparing different construction methods

3. **[Scale Cuts and Data Filtering](two_point_scale_cuts.qmd)**
   - Applying physical scale cuts using TwoPointBinFilterCollection
   - Defining valid analysis ranges for tracer combinations
   - Using TwoPointExperiment for managing analysis configurations
   - Serializing experiment configurations to YAML

4. **[Integration Methods](two_point_integration.qmd)**
   - Controlling integration methods for harmonic-space calculations
   - Comparing Limber approximation vs. FKEM methods
   - Understanding accuracy trade-offs
   - Configuring ClIntegrationOptions

### Related: Generator Workflow

5. **[Two-Point Generators](two_point_generators.qmd)**
   - Creating two-point statistics from scratch using generated metadata
   - Defining systematics factories (WeakLensingFactory, NumberCountsFactory)
   - Generating LSST-SRD redshift distributions
   - Alternative to loading from SACC files

## Quick Start

**Choose your workflow:**

- **Have a SACC file?** Start with [Two-Point Factory Basics](two_point_factory_basics.qmd), then proceed through [Loading SACC Data](two_point_sacc_loading.qmd) to understand how to work with real data.

- **Generating from scratch?** Use the [Two-Point Generators](two_point_generators.qmd) tutorial to create metadata and two-point statistics programmatically.
