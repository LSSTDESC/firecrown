## Purpose of this Document

In the tutorial [Two Point Generators](two_point_generators.qmd) we show how to use generators to create the necessary metadata to instantiate `TwoPoint` objects.
In addition to generators, the user has also the option to use data already saved in a `SACC` object (or file) to initialize the `TwoPoint` objects.
In this tutorial we show how to extract the metadata and data from `SACC` object and use the metadata and a factory to initialize the objects.

## `SACC` objects

The `SACC` objects are used to store all necessary information for a statistical analysis. 
In practice, it stores metadata (data layout, data type, bins, dependent variables, etc), calibration data (redshift distribution per bin $\mathrm{d}n/\mathrm{d}z$) and the covariance between all measurements. 
In the tutorials [`InferredGalaxyZDist`](inferred_zdist.qmd), [`InferredGalaxyZDist` Generators](inferred_zdist_generators.qmd) and [`InferredGalaxyZDist` Serialization](inferred_zdist_serialization.qmd) we show how to use, generate and serialize the `InferredGalaxyZDist` objects describing the redshift distributions. In this document we extract these components from a `SACC` object.

## Metadata only `SACC`

Up to the version 1.7 Firecrown relied on a two phase construction for its likelihoods.
During the first phase, the `Likelihood`, `Statistics` and `Systematics` objects are created with metadata only.
Then, the user must call the `read` method passing a `SACC` object to finish the object construction.

One shortcoming of this methodology is that the user must know the `SACC` object struct beforehand, so they can create the necessary objects.
Then, a matching `SACC` object must be passed in the `read` phase.
To simplify this, we introduced functions to extract the metadata from the `SACC` file, such that it can be used toguether with the factories to create the objects.

In the code below we extract the metadata from the `examples/des_y1_3x2pt` `SACC` file.
```{python}
from firecrown.metadata.two_point import extract_all_data_types_xi_thetas
import sacc

sacc_data = sacc.Sacc.load_fits("../examples/des_y1_3x2pt/des_y1_3x2pt_sacc_data.fits")

all_meta = extract_all_data_types_xi_thetas(sacc_data)
```

The metadata can be seem below:
```{python}
# | code-fold: true
import yaml
from IPython.display import Markdown

all_meta_prune = [
    {
        "data_type": meta["data_type"],
        "tracer1": str(meta["tracer_names"].name1),
        "tracer2": str(meta["tracer_names"].name2),
    }
    for meta in all_meta
]

all_meta_yaml = yaml.safe_dump(all_meta_prune, default_flow_style=False)

Markdown(f"```yaml\n{all_meta_yaml}\n```")
```

The tracer names above are ones from the `SACC` object. 
The user needs to know the tracer names to create the `TwoPoint` objects.
However, now the user can use the metadata to create the objects.

### Factories

The factories are used to create the `TwoPoint` objects.
In Firecrown, we write factories using Pydantic, a library to validate and parse data.
This gives us the advantage of having a schema for the data, and the user can use the factories to validate the data before creating the objects.

For example, we can organize the factories in a YAML file:
```{python}

from firecrown.likelihood.two_point import TwoPoint
from firecrown.likelihood.weak_lensing import WeakLensingFactory
from firecrown.likelihood.number_counts import NumberCountsFactory
from firecrown.utils import base_model_from_yaml

weak_lensing_yaml = """
per_bin_systematics:
- type: MultiplicativeShearBiasFactory
- type: PhotoZShiftFactory
global_systematics:
- type: LinearAlignmentSystematicFactory
  alphag: 1.0
"""
number_counts_yaml = """
per_bin_systematics:
- type: PhotoZShiftFactory
global_systematics: []
"""

weak_lensing_factory = base_model_from_yaml(WeakLensingFactory, weak_lensing_yaml)
number_counts_factory = base_model_from_yaml(NumberCountsFactory, number_counts_yaml)

two_point_list = TwoPoint.from_metadata_only_real(
    metadata=all_meta, wl_factory=weak_lensing_factory, nc_factory=number_counts_factory
)
```

### Creating a `Likelihood` object

Now we can create a `Likelihood` object using the `TwoPoint` objects.
Since we are using the metadata only, we need to pass the `SACC` object to the `read` method.
```{python}
from firecrown.likelihood.gaussian import ConstGaussian

likelihood = ConstGaussian(two_point_list)

likelihood.read(sacc_data)

```

## Extracting the Metadata and Data

In the previous section, we demonstrated how to extract metadata from a `SACC object`. 
Now, we will show how to extract all components from the `SACC` object, including the metadata, data, and calibration data.

In the upcoming interface for Firecrown, likelihood objects will be created using the complete data. 
This data may be extracted from a `SACC` object, generated by a custom generator, or provided in any other manner by the user.

In the code below we extract all components from the `examples/des_y1_3x2pt` `SACC` file.
```{python}
from firecrown.metadata.two_point import extract_all_tracers_types
from pprint import pprint

tracer_types = extract_all_tracers_types(sacc_data)

pprint(tracer_types)
```
