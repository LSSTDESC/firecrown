There are two options for working on the Firecrown code.
One is to do an *editable installation* using `python -m pip install --no-deps -e`; the other is to directly use the `setup.py` script.
We recommend use of the `python -m pip install --no-deps -e .`; direct use of the `setup.py` file is deprecated with recent versions of `setuputils`.

```{.bash}
cd ${FIRECROWN_DIR}
python -m pip install --no-deps -e .
```

We recommend `python -m pip ...` rather than direct use of `pip ...` to help ensure that the `pip` that is found is the one consistent with the `python` used by the environment.
Note the inclusion of the `--no-deps` option; this helps make sure that no *other* packages are accidentally installed.
If running this command fails because of a missing dependency, you should install the required produce using `conda` rather than `pip`.
