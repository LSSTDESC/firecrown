There are two options for working on the Firecrown code.
One is to do an *editable installation* using `pip install -e`; the other is to directly use the `setup.py` script.
We caution against using the editable installation because it does not deal gracefully with the removal of files during development.
We recommend instead building by directly using the `setup.py` script.
We also recommend removing any previous build before making a new build; this assures that no old artifacts are ever used.
The steps below thus guarantee a clean build:

```{.bash}
cd ${FIRECROWN_DIR}
# We clean up any previous build to ensure stale code is never found
# by python.
rm -rf build/*
python setup.py build
```
Remember to do these steps after each set of modifications to the code.
