## Introduction

In this tutorial we describe the handling of systematic uncertainties in Firecrown.

In Firecrown, *systematics* are used to modify the way a theory object works, so that the prediction made by the modified theory object reflects an effect not present in the original theory.
Often they are characterized by some unknown parameter which can be marginalized over in analysis.

Systematics do not act on the output of the theory predictions.
Instead, they act on *tracer arguments* objects, which are *data classes*[^dataclass] that contain the configuration data needed by the theory.

A tracer argument object encapsulates all the information needed to create a `pyccl` tracer object.
A `SourceSystematic` object modifies a `TracerArg` in some way. Source tracer objects, such as `NumberCounts` and `WeakLensing`, require configuration details, calibration inputs, and model parameters.

All source tracers share a common requirement: a redshift distribution (e.g., the galaxy redshift distribution). 
To address this, we use a shared `SourceGalaxyArgs` class, which includes the redshift distribution, a generic `scale` parameter, and a `field` parameter specifying the power spectrum field to use.

This shared structure allows us to define a common set of systematics that can be applied across all source tracers. 
For instance, the `PhotoZShift` object modifies the redshift distribution in a `SourceGalaxyArgs` object.

The subclasses `WeakLensingArgs` and `NumberCountsArgs` inherit from `SourceGalaxyArgs` and add additional fields specific to weak lensing and number counts, respectively.
The `WeakLensingSystematic` and `NumberCountsSystematic` classes inherit from `SourceGalaxySystematic` using Python's *generics* to enforce that they can only be applied to `WeakLensingArgs` and `NumberCountsArgs` objects, respectively.

## Example
Give a simple-to-understand and non-contentious example here, one that we can use throughout the discussion of the rest of this tutorial.

## Other things to write about in this section.

* per-bin systematics
* global systematics

Recall we are considering modifying the design so that systematics are recognized as being per-bin or "global", which means specific to a particular survey, but not a particular bin, based on either state information in the systematic or perhaps based on the type of the systematic.
:::

A specific systematic may apply only to certain varieties of measurement, e.g. photometric redshifts an not spectroscopic redshifts.

The class `SourceSystematic`[^1] is the base class for all source systematics.
A systematic represents a source of uncertainty in some measurement associated with a source.
One concrete example is `PhotoZShift`[^2], which encapsulate a shift in the center of redshift bins for measurements based on photometric measurement of the redshift.

[^1]: `firecrown.likelihood.source.SourceSystematic` is the full name of this class.

[^2]: There are actually two classes named `PhotoZShift`: one is `firecrown.likelihood.weak_lensing.PhotoZShift`; the other is `firecrown.likelihood.number_counts.PhotoZShift`.
      They are both derived from the `firecrown.likelihood.source.SourceSystematic` base class.

Derived from `SourceSystematic`, and defined in the same module, is the class `SourceGalaxySystematic`.
This class includes the `apply` method which is used to apply the systematic to a source galaxy tracer argument.
It also introduces a restriction that subclasses of `SourceGalaxySystematic` can only be applied to source galaxy tracers.[^other]
This restriction will be enforced by the `mypy` type checker.
This is done using the Python type systems support of *generics*.[^generics]
The goal of this restriction is to avoid having systematics intended for one variety of observation (e.g. a weak lensing source) being applied to an inappropriate other variety of observation.

[^generics]: You can read about generics in the [online Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#generics).
[^other]: We expect a future version of Firecrown to introduce non-galaxy based measurements (e.g. CMB), and thus non-galaxy based systematics.

The final abstract parts of the class hierarchy are two subclasses of `SourceGalaxySystematic`: `WeakLensingSystematic` and `NumberCountsSystematic`.
These classes are used to apply systematics to weak lensing and number counts predictions, respectively.
The various concrete systematics classes (such as the two `PhotoZShift` classes noted above) directly inherit from one of these two classes.

## Creating Systematics Objects

### Direct Creation

Systematics objects of all types can be created directly by using the constructor function that takes a single argument, the name of the tracer associated with the data that the systematic is applied to.
This tracer name is used as a prefix for the parameters of the systematic.
The systematic will have *attributes* with names corresponding to the parameter names *without* the tracer name prefix; initially, these attribute values will all be `None`.
The systematic can be queried for the names of its parameters:

```{python}
import firecrown.likelihood.number_counts as nc
systematic = nc.MagnificationBiasSystematic(sacc_tracer="lens0")
print("The parameter names of this systematic are:")
for name in systematic.get_params_names():
    print(f"\t{name}")
```

We can also inspect the attributes of the systematic using built-in Python functions.
Because all systematic classes also inherit from `Updatable`, they also have several additional attributes we can view:

```{python}
# Continuing from above...
for name, value in vars(systematic).items():
    print(f"\t{name}: {value}")
```

In this case, we see that all of the parameters of this systematic are *sampler parameters*.
This means that when using them in a MCMC analysis, the MCMC framework will sample over them.

```{python}
# Continuing from above...
for p in systematic._sampler_parameters:
  print(f"\tname: {p.name}")
```

Before it can be `apply`ed, the systematic object needs to be updated using the `update` method, which takes a `ParamsMap` object that must provide values for all the parameters in that systematic.
After having been updated, the systematic object will have its attribute values set to the supplied values.

::: {.callout-important}
## Why does a systematic have redundant data?

It appears that this systematic has the names and values of each of its "parameters" two different ways:

1. as an attribute of the object, and
2. as a `SamplerParameter` object that has the same name and value as the related attribute.

Can we remove the redundancy?
:::

Before it can be `apply`ed, the systematic object needs to be updated using the `update` method, which takes a `ParamsMap` object that must provide values for all the parameters in that systematic.
After having been updated, the systematic object will have its attribute values set to the supplied valies.

```{python}
# Continuing from above...
import firecrown.parameters as params
systematic.update(params.ParamsMap({
    "lens0_eta": 19.0,
    "lens0_r_lim": 24.0,
    "lens0_sig_c" :9.83,
    "lens0_z_c": 0.39,
    "lens0_z_m": 0.055,
    }))
for name, value in vars(systematic).items():
  print(f"\t{name}: {value}")
```
It is also possible to query a newly-created systematic for the names and default values of its parameters:

```{python}
# Continuing from above...
import firecrown.updatable as up
# make a new systematic object (reusing the name from above)
systematic = nc.MagnificationBiasSystematic(sacc_tracer="lens0")
# get the default parameter values
default_parameters = up.get_default_params_map(systematic)

for name, value in default_parameters.items():
  print(f"\t{name}: {value}")
```

We can use this `ParamsMap` to update the systematic:

```{python}
# Continuing from above...
systematic.update(default_parameters)
for name, value in vars(systematic).items():
  print(f"\t{name}: {value}")
```

### Systematic Factories

Systematics objects are usually created by *factories*, with each systematic class having an associated factory class.
The purpose of having the factory is so that the creation of the systematics objects can be characterized in a uniform way, through a YAML document or a fragment of a YAML document.

## Applying Systematics

::: {.callout-important}
## Provide an example of applying systematics here.

This should continue the example from above, showing how systematics are applied to a prediction by the framework.
:::

## Writing a New Systematic

::: {.callout-important}
## Provide an example of writing a new systematic here.

It would be reproduce, with a different name, an already-existing example that exercises all the features of the systematics framework.
The example should show:

1. How to define the systematic class, including documentation.
2. How to define the factory class, including documentation.
3. How to test the factory and the systematic.
