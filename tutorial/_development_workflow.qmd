All the tools provided in Firecrown exist to help you to create an instance of a likelihood for your analysis.
The function that is used to create this likelihood is called a *factory function*.
Note that this likelihood function is not creating a new type; it is responsible for creating an instance of the type (e.g. `ConstGaussian`) you have chosen for your analysis.
The purpose of this factory function is to assemble the artifacts representing the data, modeling effects, systematic effects, etc., into a likelihood object, and to return that likelihood object (and the related modeling tools).

We will concentrate here on the workflow for creating a likelihood that uses `TwoPoint` statistics.
Before creating the statistics, we have to create the sources, then the statistics.
One typically creates several sources, both weak lensing sources and number count sources.

Once all the sources are created, we create a `TwoPoint` statistic for each pair of source combinations that we want to use. 
Naturally, these combinations must be present in the `sacc.Sacc` object.
One is free to use just a subset of the available combinations.

Note that, each source has a list of systematics that are applied to it. 
These systematics can be shared between sources, or they can be specific to a given source.
When specific to a given source, any parameter name that is used in the systematic is prefixed with the name of the source.
In contrast, when a systematic is shared between sources, the parameter names are not prefixed.

Currently, the `TwoPoint` statistic caches the `pyccl.Tracer`s that are created for each source.
This is done to avoid creating the same `Tracer` multiple times.
We are planning to change this behavior in the future in order to avoid the need to cache the `Tracer`s.
