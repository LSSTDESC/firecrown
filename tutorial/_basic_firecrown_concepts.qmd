The three most important concepts represented in Firecrown are *cosmology*, *modeling tools*, and *likelihoods*.
Each of these concepts is represented by some software artifact in Firecrown.

Firecrown's concept of cosmology is provided by CCL.
CCL provides all the necessary tools for calculating basic cosmological quantities.
So everything that is general in cosmology is calculated by CCL, and not by Firecrown itself.
This cosmology plays a central role in the set of tools provided to the user.

We also have the concept of modeling tools.
These are a set of extra tools which, together with the CCL cosmology, allow one to calculate likelihoods.
For example, modeling tools has a member called pt_calculator. 
When the `ModelingTools` is instantiated in the likelihood initialization, the pt_calculator is also instantiated and configured.
Then, the same object can be used by different parts of the likelihood.
The `des_y1_3x2pt_PT` example uses the pt_calculator to calculate the power spectra that are used in the likelihood. 
Thus, every `source` that requires power spectra can use the same pt_calculator object.
All the available tools are presented, along with the cosmology, for calculation of the likelihood.
Therefore, during a statistical analysis, whenever the likelihood is called, all the objects in the modeling tools have already been updated to represent the "current cosmology" with which they are associated.
For the user who wants to calculate a likelihood that is not a Gaussian distribution, these are the only concepts in Firecrown that are needed.
But since we are frequently working with Gaussian likelihoods, there are more software tools available for their support.
These tools include more constrained *likelihoods*,  *statistics*, *sources*, and *systematics*.

First, we have support for the Gaussian family of likelihoods.
These are all the likelihoods that can be expressed as a function of the distance between the expected value of some observable quantity and the observed value of that quantity, where the measure of that distance is characterized by a covariance matrix.
These are likelihoods of the form:
$$P(\vec{x}|\vec{\mu},\widetilde{M}) = f(\chi^2)$$
where
$$\chi^2 = \sum_{i,j} (x_i - \mu_i) M_{i,j} (x_j - \mu_j)$$
and where $x_i$ are the components of the observed data vector $\vec{x}$, $\mu_i$ are the components of the predicted theory vector $\vec{\mu}$, and $M_{i,j}$ is the components of the inverse of the covariance matrix.
In the Gaussian family, we currently have implemented the multivariate Gaussian distribution and the multivariate Student's T distribution.

To build a Gaussian distribution, all one needs is to create a *theory vector* (the $\mu_i$ above), and to get the *data vector* ($x_i$ above) and covariance matrix $\widetilde{C} = \widetilde{M}^{-1}$.
The data vector and covariance matrix are typically read from a SACC file.
The theoretical prediction associated with the data vector is computed by a *statistic* array.
Users have the flexibility to either implement their own statistics objects or utilize existing ones already available within Firecrown.
For instance, in the case of constructing a likelihood based on a two-point function, Firecrown provides pre-existing classes that represent such entities, readily accessible for utilization.
The two-point function is a variety of statistic that is in turn dependent on *sources*.
Sources are tools available for combining two observables (possibly the same observable, used twice) to create a two-point function, either a cross-correlation or an auto-correlation.
These are simple layers to call the relevant CCL functions that will calculate the necessary integrals, whereas sources are used to compute integrands for the associated observables.
So a statistic is a general concept, a two-point statistic is a specific kind of statistic, and sources are the means to calculate the observables for two-point statistics.

The *systematic* is a concept that is not yet so fully defined.
Currently, systematics are a way of modifying the behavior of a theory prediction calculator.
For example, if one has a distribution $f(z) = dN/dz$ of some object in the sky as a function of redshift $z$, and one wants to make a shift of this distribution (a *bias*) to the left or the right, this can be done using a systematic.
One can put as many systematics as desired into the calculation of any statistic.
Of course, one needs to take care that they are compatible and that the result makes sense.
This is one of the parts of Firecrown that needs more development[^invitation]; we are working to identify the set of types and functions that will help make sure that only meaningful combinations of systematics are created, and that systematic effects are not double-counted.

[^invitation]: We invite contributions to the effort of defining the means of handling systematic effects.
