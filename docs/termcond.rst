License and Conditions of Use
=============================

This software was developed within the LSSTDESC using LSST DESC resources, and
so meets the criteria given in, and is bound by, the LSST DESC Publication
Policy for being a “DESC product”. We welcome requests to access the code for
non-DESC use; if you wish to use the code outside DESC please contact the
developers.

The firecrown package is still under development and should be considered work
in progress. If you make use of any of the ideas or software in this package in
your own research, please cite them as "(LSST DESC, in preparation)" and provide
a link to this repository: https://github.com/LSSTDESC/firecrown. If you have
comments, questions, or feedback, please
`make an issue <https://github.com/LSSTDESC/firecrown/issues>`_.

firecrown calls the CCL library: https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CCL, which makes
use of `CLASS`. For free use of the `CLASS` library, the `CLASS` developers
require that the `CLASS` paper be cited:

    CLASS II: Approximation schemes, D. Blas, J. Lesgourgues, T. Tram,
    arXiv:1104.2933, JCAP 1107 (2011) 034.

The `CLASS` repository can be found in http://class-code.net. CCL also uses code
from the `FFTLog <http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/FFTLog/>`_ package. We have
obtained permission from the FFTLog author to include modified versions of his
source code.
