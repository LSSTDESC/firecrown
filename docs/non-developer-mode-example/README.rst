Using Firecrown in non-developer mode
=====================================

An important difference between using Firecrown in developer mode and non-developer mode involves how paths used in likelihood scripts and CosmoSIS `ini` files are specified.
These examples show the correct usage for non-developer mode (the examples in the Firecrown repository are set up for developer mode).
