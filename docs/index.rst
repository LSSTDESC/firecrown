Welcome to firecrown's documentation!
=====================================

Firecrown is a Python package that provides the DESC *framework* to implement likelihoods,
as well as specific likelihood implementations. Firecrown is intended to be usable *from*
external statistical analysis tools.

Currently, it supports both Cobaya and CosmoSIS, providing the necessary classes or modules
to allow users of Cobaya or CosmoSIS to call any Firecrown likelihood from within those
samplers.

* `Cobaya <https://github.com/CobayaSampler/cobaya>`_
* `CosmoSIS <https://github.com/joezuntz/cosmosis>`_

It can also be used as a library in other contexts, and so the installation of
Firecrown does not *require* the installation of a sampler.
