"""Theoretical models for cosmological observables.

This module provides implementations of theoretical models used to compute
predictions for cosmological observables.

Submodules
----------
- cluster: Models for galaxy cluster observables, including cluster abundance
  and weak lensing around clusters (DeltaSigma).
- two_point: Models for two-point correlation functions and power spectra.
