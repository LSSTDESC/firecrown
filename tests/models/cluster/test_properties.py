"""Tests for the cluster properties module."""

# Note: ClusterProperty is an enum defined in _properties.py
# Currently there are no dedicated unit tests for this module beyond
# its usage in other test files. This file serves as a placeholder
# for future unit tests specific to ClusterProperty enum functionality.
