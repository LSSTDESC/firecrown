The firecrown package is still under development and should be considered work in progress. 
If you make use of any of the ideas or software in this package in your own research, please cite them as 
"(LSST DESC, in preparation)" and provide a link to this repository: https://github.com/LSSTDESC/firecrown. 
If you have comments, questions, or feedback, please [make an issue](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/firecrown/issues).

firecrown calls the CCL library: https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CCL, which makes use of `CLASS`. For free use of the 
`CLASS` library, the `CLASS` developers require that the `CLASS` paper be cited: 
CLASS II: Approximation schemes, D. Blas, J. Lesgourgues, T. Tram, arXiv:1104.2933, JCAP 1107 (2011) 034. 
The `CLASS` repository can be found in http://class-code.net. CCL also uses code from the 
[FFTLog](http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/FFTLog/) package.  We have obtained permission from the FFTLog 
author to include modified versions of his source code.
