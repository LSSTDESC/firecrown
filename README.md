firecrown calls the CCL library: https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CCL, which makes
use of `CLASS`. For free use of the `CLASS` library, the `CLASS` developers
require that the `CLASS` paper be cited:

    CLASS II: Approximation schemes, D. Blas, J. Lesgourgues, T. Tram,
    arXiv:1104.2933, JCAP 1107 (2011) 034.

The `CLASS` repository can be found in http://class-code.net. CCL also uses
code from the [FFTLog](http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/FFTLog/) package.  We
have obtained permission from the FFTLog author to include modified versions of
his source code.
