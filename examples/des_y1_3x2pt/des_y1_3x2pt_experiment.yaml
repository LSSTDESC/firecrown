# This file contains all information about the DES Y1 3x2pt experiment.

# The 'data_source:' field points to the SACC file containing the DES Y1 3x2pt data vector 
# and covariance matrix, which is used for analysis.

# The 'two_point_factory:' field points to the factory that will create the TwoPoint 
# objects. These objects represent the chosen theoretical models for each data point 
# found in the SACC file.

  sacc_data_file: des_y1_3x2pt_sacc_data.fits

# The two point statistics are defined by the TwoPoint objects. The TwoPoint statistics
# are created using the factories defined in this file.
