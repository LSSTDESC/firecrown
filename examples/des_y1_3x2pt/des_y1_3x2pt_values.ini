; Parameters and data in CosmoSIS are organized into sections
; so we can easily see what they mean.
; There is only one section in this case, called cosmological_parameters
[cosmological_parameters]

; These are the only parameters being varied.

; The following parameters are set, but not varied.

; omega_c is not set, because the consistency module sets it to omega_m - omega_b
