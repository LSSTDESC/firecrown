# This file contains the configuration for the two-point statistic factories that are
# used to calculate the two-point statistics for the DES Y1 3x2pt analysis.

# In this example, we use the DES Y1 3x2pt data vector and covariance matrix stored in
# the sacc file des_y1_3x2pt_sacc_data.fits.

# The two point statistics are defined by the TwoPoint objects. The TwoPoint statistics
# are created using the factories defined in this file.
